#Proof of Concept - Authentication by verifying token generated by keycloak

Run a local version of keycloak. The following docker containers can be used to start a keycloak instance which is backed
up by a MySQL database.

```bash
% docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_DATABASE=keycloak -e MYSQL_USER=keycloak -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=password -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password -p 3306:3306 -d mysql
% docker run --name keycloak -e KEYCLOAK_USER=admin -e KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin -p 8080:8080 --link mysql:mysql jboss/keycloak-mysql
```
This creates a keycloak instance that you can access at localhost:8080/auth. It will create an 'admin' user with password, 'admin'.
You can create other users. The keycloak_example.py is set up to decode tokens for the security-admin-console audience. You will
need to go to this client and have dev tools on to grab the JWT token. This can be done be going to Realm Settings and clicking on the Keys
tab. The token will be in the request header, Authorization. Do not include the word "Bearer". You can create other users and add to
the admin role to test other users. To make things easier on you for testing, you may want to increase the token 
expiration time. That can be done on the Realm Settings page, in the Tokens tab.

To run the keycloak_example.py script, create a python3 virtual environment. This has been tested with 3.6. Then use pip to 
install the requirements. We are using PyJWT to decode the tokens. See https://pyjwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
for more information about this package. We also will need to install the cryptography package which is 
needed because keycloak uses RSA to sign the tokens. 

```bash
% virtualenv --python=python3 env
% env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Paste in your JWT token. Go to the Keys tab in Realm Settings and click on the Public Key for the RSA Type key. This will 
pop up a text box with the public key. Paste that into keycloak_example.py.

Run the script - ```env/bin/python keycloak_example.py```. This should print out the verified token.

In the real application, we will grab the token from the request.headers['Authorization']. The public key should be specified
as an environment variable that gets put in the app.config object. Example config.py
```python
import os

PUBLIC_API_KEY = os.environ.get('PUBLIC_API_KEY', '')
```

Questions/issues that remain:
1. How to configure authorization in python applications - start by looking at how this is configured in the springboot applications.
2. Implementation - how to make it easy to add this to all of our python applications. May want to consider some sort
of python module/package that can be imported into all applications. Alternatively, see what may be available as a Flask add-on
or plugin.
3. Can we use the above setup to easily test locally ... especially when testing microservices in isolation?
